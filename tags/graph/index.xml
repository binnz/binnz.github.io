      <title>Community Detection in Graphs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a graph structure, what can be called a community?
The notion of community structure captures the tendency of nodes to be organized into groups and members within a community are more similar among each other.
Typically, a community in graphs/networks is a set of nodes with more/better/stronger connections between its members, than to the rest of the network.
However, there is no widely accepted single definition.
It depends heavily on the application domain and the properies of the graph.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is Link Prediction?
Given a snapshot of a network at time $t$, predict edges added in the interval $(t,t&#39;)$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Type of Predictions:
- Link existance (binary classification problem)
- Link weight (regression problem). E.g., predicting movie rating for users
- Link type (multi-class classification problem) --&gt;</description>

      <title>Label Propagation</title>
      <link>https://binnz.github.io/post/2020-05-24-label-propagation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Labelling/Annotating data is very expensive.
Therefore, usualy we have only small amounts of labelled data and large amounts of unlabelled data.
To predict the labels fo the unlabelled data, we can use the graph-based semi-supervised machine learning technique called &lt;strong&gt;Label Propagation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is label propagation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) is an iterative algorithm where we assign labels to unlabelled points by propagating labels through the dataset.
For example, if we are given a graph with partially labelled nodes, for any unlabelled node, we can either adopt the dominant label in its neighborhood or wait until a label &amp;ldquo;propagates&amp;rdquo; to it if its neighborhood does not have any label.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Web Graph and Page Ranking</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, we first discuss the structure of the Web as a graph consisting a large number of pages and connected by hyperlinks.
Then to rank the pages in the World Wide Web, we introduce PageRank and talk about some of its weakness as a general approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Random Walks on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://binnz.github.io/post/2020-05-20-random-walks/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A random walk is known as a stochastic or random process which describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps on some mathematical space:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;given a graph and a starting point, select a neighbour at random&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;move to the selected neighbour and repeat the same process till a termination condition is verified&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the random sequence of points selected in this way is a &lt;em&gt;random walk&lt;/em&gt; of the graph&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>A Real-World Example of Network Graph</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In June 2006, MSN Messenger had 30 billion conversations among 240 million people.
From the data, the MSN network is constructed as a communication graph with $n = 180 \text{ million}$ nodes and $m = 1.3 \text{ billion}$ undirected edges.
To investigate the properties of large-scale networks, we take the real-world data, MSN network, as an example and discover its macroscopic properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diameter&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;What is the degrees of separation in this network?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clustering coefficient&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;What fraction of my friends are also friends themselves?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Degree distribution&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Are there many &amp;ldquo;hubs&amp;rdquo; in the network?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connectivity&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;How many &amp;ldquo;islands&amp;rdquo; and how big are they?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Erdos-Renyi Random Graph</title>
      <link>https://binnz.github.io/post/2020-05-15-gnp/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;$G(n, p)$, the Erdos-Renyi Random Graph, defines a family of graphs, each of which starts with $n$ isolated nodes, and we place an edge between each distinct node pair with probability $p$.
In $G(n, p)$ Model, the probability of obtaining any one particular random graph with $m$ edges is $p^{m}(1-p)^{N-m}$ with the notation $N=\binom{n}{2}$.
As a result, $G(n, p)$ defines a bigger familiy than $G(n, m)$ since $n$ and $p$ do not uniquely determine the graph so number of possible graphs are larger.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kleinberg&#39;s Model of Small-Worlds</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kleinberg&amp;rsquo;s model presents the infinite family of &lt;strong&gt;navigable Small-World networks&lt;/strong&gt; that generalizes Watts-Strogatz model.
Moreover, with Kleinberg&amp;rsquo;s model it is shown that &lt;strong&gt;short paths not only exist but can be found with limited knowledge of the global network&lt;/strong&gt;. Decentralized search algorithms can find short paths with high probability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Random Graph Models</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In mathematics, random graph is the general term to refer to probability distributions over graphs.
Random graphs may be described simply by a probability distribution, or by a random process which generates them (Bollob√°s 2001).
From a mathematical perspective, random graphs are found to model and mirror the diverse types of complex networks encountered in different areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Watts-Strogatz model is a random graph generation model that produces graphs with &lt;strong&gt;small-world properties&lt;/strong&gt;, including &lt;strong&gt;short average path lengths&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;high clustering&lt;/strong&gt;.
To check the simulation of a small world model, &lt;a href=&#34;http://netlogoweb.org/launch#http://netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Networks/Small%20Worlds.nlogo&#34;&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt; is very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Centrality Measures of Graph Nodes</title>
      <link>https://binnz.github.io/post/2020-05-14-centrality/</link>

      <guid>https://binnz.github.io/post/2020-05-14-centrality/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Suppose we are given a graph data $G = (N, E)$, which contains $|N| = n$ nodes and $|E| = m$ edges.
One big question we often ask is: &amp;ldquo;Which vertices are important?&amp;rdquo;
Intuitively, we would consider a &amp;ldquo;star&amp;rdquo; (the central node that connects a lot of other nodes) as an obviously important case and also consider nodes in a &amp;ldquo;circle&amp;rdquo; are equivalently important.
In general, we can use cantrality measures to rank the nodes in a graph.
There are many centrality measures and page rank is currently the most prominent approach that deals with directed graphs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Graph Fundamentals</title>
      <link>https://binnz.github.io/post/2020-05-12-graph/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The data reflecting our real world can be represented in networks sometimes.   With network data, we can ask questions such as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the patterns and statistical properties of network data?   Why networks are the way they are? Can we find the underlying rules that build these networks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we model the networks?   Can we predict behavior? Why/How things go viral?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the network structure evolve over time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer the questions, we need to understand network properties (e.g., diameter, scale-free / power law network, small-world behavior), network models that fit our observations (e.g., Erdos Renyi random graphs, Kleinberg‚Äôs model models, &amp;hellip; etc), and algorithms that could unflod on our networks (e.g., page rank, decentralized search, label propagation, link prediction, community detection, &amp;hellip; etc).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
