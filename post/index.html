    <h1 itemprop="name">Community Detection in Graphs</h1>
    <p itemprop="description"><p>In a graph structure, what can be called a community?
The notion of community structure captures the tendency of nodes to be organized into groups and members within a community are more similar among each other.
Typically, a community in graphs/networks is a set of nodes with more/better/stronger connections between its members, than to the rest of the network.
However, there is no widely accepted single definition.
It depends heavily on the application domain and the properies of the graph.</p></p>

    <h1 itemprop="name">Label Propagation</h1>
    <p itemprop="description"><p>Labelling/Annotating data is very expensive.
Therefore, usualy we have only small amounts of labelled data and large amounts of unlabelled data.
To predict the labels fo the unlabelled data, we can use the graph-based semi-supervised machine learning technique called <strong>Label Propagation</strong>.</p>
<p>So what is label propagation?</p>
<p>Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) is an iterative algorithm where we assign labels to unlabelled points by propagating labels through the dataset.
For example, if we are given a graph with partially labelled nodes, for any unlabelled node, we can either adopt the dominant label in its neighborhood or wait until a label &ldquo;propagates&rdquo; to it if its neighborhood does not have any label.</p></p>

As a result, $G(n, p)$ defines a bigger familiy than $G(n, m)$ since $n$ and $p$ do not uniquely determine the graph so number of possible graphs are larger.</p></p>

    <p itemprop="description"><p>Suppose we are given a graph data $G = (N, E)$, which contains $|N| = n$ nodes and $|E| = m$ edges.
One big question we often ask is: &ldquo;Which vertices are important?&rdquo;
Intuitively, we would consider a &ldquo;star&rdquo; (the central node that connects a lot of other nodes) as an obviously important case and also consider nodes in a &ldquo;circle&rdquo; are equivalently important.
In general, we can use cantrality measures to rank the nodes in a graph.
There are many centrality measures and page rank is currently the most prominent approach that deals with directed graphs.</p></p>

    <p itemprop="description"><p>The data reflecting our real world can be represented in networks sometimes.   With network data, we can ask questions such as</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the patterns and statistical properties of network data?   Why networks are the way they are? Can we find the underlying rules that build these networks?</li>
<li>Can we model the networks?   Can we predict behavior? Why/How things go viral?</li>
<li>How does the network structure evolve over time?</li>
</ul>
<p>To answer the questions, we need to understand network properties (e.g., diameter, scale-free / power law network, small-world behavior), network models that fit our observations (e.g., Erdos Renyi random graphs, Kleinberg’s model models, &hellip; etc), and algorithms that could unflod on our networks (e.g., page rank, decentralized search, label propagation, link prediction, community detection, &hellip; etc).</p></p>

<p>The assignment uses data to answer specific question about global health and economics. The data contradicts commonly held preconceived notions.

    <p itemprop="description"><p>Numbers of cluster validity measures have been proposed to help us not only with the validation of our clustering result but also with cluster number selection.</p>
<p>For fuzzy clustering, we can optimize our clustering results with some validity measure such as Partition Coefficient, Partition Entropy, XB-index, and Overlaps Separation Measure.</p>
<p>For hard clustering, we can use measures such as DB index and Dunn index.</p>
<p>And for hierarchical clustering, we can select the best $k$ by stopping at the &ldquo;Big Jump&rdquo; of distances while performing agglomerative clustering.</p></p>

    <h1 itemprop="name">Probabilistic D-Clustering</h1>
    <p itemprop="description"><p>Probabilistic D-Clustering is a new iterative method for probabilistic clustering of data.   Given clusters, their centers and the distances of data points from these centers, the probability of cluster membership at any point is assumed inversely proportional to the distance from (the center of) the cluster. This assumption is the working principle of Probabilistic D-Clustering.</p>
<p>At each iteration, the distances (Euclidean, Mahalanobis, etc.) from the cluster centers are computed for all data points, and the centers are updated as convex combinations of these points, with weights determined by the above principle.</p>
<p>Progress is monitored by the joint distance function, a measure of distance from all cluster centers, that evolves during the iterations, and captures the data in its low contours.</p>
<p>This method is simple, fast (requiring a small number of cheap iterations) and insensitive to outliers.</p></p>

    <p itemprop="description"><p>Elasticsearch is a <strong>distributed</strong>, <strong>real-time</strong>, search and analytics platform.</p>
<p>Using a restful API, Elasticsearch saves data and indexes it automatically. It assigns types to fields and that way a search can be done smartly and quickly using filters and different queries.</p>
<p>It’s uses <strong>JVM</strong> in order to be as fast as possible. It distributes indexes in “shards” of data. It replicates shards in different nodes, so it’s distributed and clusters can function even if not all nodes are operational. Adding nodes is super easy and that’s what makes it so scalable.</p>
<p>ES uses <strong>Lucene</strong> to solve searches. This is quite an advantage with comparing with, for example, Django query strings. A <strong>restful API</strong> call allows us to perform searches using json objects as parameters, making it much more flexible and giving each search parameter within the object a different weight, importance and or priority.</p></p>

    <p itemprop="description"><p>In iterative clustering algorithms, the procedure adopted for choosing initial cluster centers is extremely important as it has a direct impact on the formation of final clusters.   <strong>It is dangerous to select outliers as initial centers, since they are away from normal samples.</strong></p>
<p>Cluster Center Initialization Algorithms (CCIA) is a density-based multi-scale data condensation.   This procedure is applicable to clustering algorithms for continuous data.   In CCIA, we assume that an individual attribute may provide some information about initial cluster center.</p></p>

    <h1 itemprop="name">Code Example of a Neural Network for The Function XOR</h1>
    <p itemprop="description"><p>It is a well-known fact, and something we have already mentioned, that 1-layer neural networks cannot predict the function XOR. 1-layer neural nets can only classify linearly separable sets, however, as we have seen, the Universal Approximation Theorem states that a 2-layer network can approximate any function, given a complex enough architecture.</p>
<p>We will now create a neural network with two neurons in the hidden layer and we will show how this can model the XOR function. However, we will write code that will allow the reader to simply modify it to allow for any number of layers and neurons in each layer, so that the reader can try simulating different scenarios. We are also going to use the hyperbolic tangent as the activity function for this network. To train the network, we will implement the back-propagation algorithm discussed earlier.</p>
<p>In addition, if you are interested in the mathemetical derivation of this implementation, please see my another post <a href="../../../2018/08/19/NN-XOR"></a>.</p></p>

    <p itemprop="description"><p>Most of data in the real-word are imbalance in nature. Imbalanced class distribution is a scenario where the number of observations belonging to one class is significantly lower than those belonging to the other classes.   This happens because Machine Learning Algorithms are usually designed to improve accuracy by reducing the error. Thus, they do not take into account the class distribution / proportion or balance of classes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Accuracy Paradox</strong>
Accuracy Paradox is the case where your accuracy measures tell the story that you have excellent accuracy (such as 90%), but the accuracy is only reflecting the underlying class distribution.</p>

<td>4</td>
<td>{Bread, Milk, Diapers, Beer}</td>

<p>A common strategy adopted by many association rule mining algorithms is to decompose the problem into 2 major subtasks:</p>
<p><strong>1. Frequent Itemset Generation</strong></p>
<p>Find all the itemsets that satisfy the <em>minsup</em> threshold.</p>
<p><strong>2. Rule Generation</strong></p></p>

<li><strong>Time series</strong>: A time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order.   A sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time (A sequence of discrete-time data).</li>
<li><strong>Time series analysis</strong>: Methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data.</li>
<li><strong>Time series forecasting</strong>: The use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.   While regression analysis is often employed in such a way as to test theories that the current values of one or more independent time series affect the current value of another time series, Time series forecasting focuses on comparing values of a single time series or multiple dependent time series at different points in time.</li>
<li><strong>Time series modeling</strong>: It involves working on time (years, days, hours, minutes) based data, to derive hidden insights to make informed decision making.</li>
