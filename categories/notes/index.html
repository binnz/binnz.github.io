    <h1 itemprop="name">Community Detection in Graphs</h1>
    <p itemprop="description"><p>In a graph structure, what can be called a community?
The notion of community structure captures the tendency of nodes to be organized into groups and members within a community are more similar among each other.
Typically, a community in graphs/networks is a set of nodes with more/better/stronger connections between its members, than to the rest of the network.
However, there is no widely accepted single definition.
It depends heavily on the application domain and the properies of the graph.</p></p>

    <h1 itemprop="name">Label Propagation</h1>
    <p itemprop="description"><p>Labelling/Annotating data is very expensive.
Therefore, usualy we have only small amounts of labelled data and large amounts of unlabelled data.
To predict the labels fo the unlabelled data, we can use the graph-based semi-supervised machine learning technique called <strong>Label Propagation</strong>.</p>
<p>So what is label propagation?</p>
<p>Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) is an iterative algorithm where we assign labels to unlabelled points by propagating labels through the dataset.
For example, if we are given a graph with partially labelled nodes, for any unlabelled node, we can either adopt the dominant label in its neighborhood or wait until a label &ldquo;propagates&rdquo; to it if its neighborhood does not have any label.</p></p>

One big question we often ask is: &ldquo;Which vertices are important?&rdquo;
Intuitively, we would consider a &ldquo;star&rdquo; (the central node that connects a lot of other nodes) as an obviously important case and also consider nodes in a &ldquo;circle&rdquo; are equivalently important.
In general, we can use cantrality measures to rank the nodes in a graph.
There are many centrality measures and page rank is currently the most prominent approach that deals with directed graphs.</p></p>

<li>Can we model the networks?   Can we predict behavior? Why/How things go viral?</li>
<li>How does the network structure evolve over time?</li>
</ul>
<p>To answer the questions, we need to understand network properties (e.g., diameter, scale-free / power law network, small-world behavior), network models that fit our observations (e.g., Erdos Renyi random graphs, Kleinberg’s model models, &hellip; etc), and algorithms that could unflod on our networks (e.g., page rank, decentralized search, label propagation, link prediction, community detection, &hellip; etc).</p></p>

    <h1 itemprop="name">Probabilistic D-Clustering</h1>
    <p itemprop="description"><p>Probabilistic D-Clustering is a new iterative method for probabilistic clustering of data.   Given clusters, their centers and the distances of data points from these centers, the probability of cluster membership at any point is assumed inversely proportional to the distance from (the center of) the cluster. This assumption is the working principle of Probabilistic D-Clustering.</p>
<p>At each iteration, the distances (Euclidean, Mahalanobis, etc.) from the cluster centers are computed for all data points, and the centers are updated as convex combinations of these points, with weights determined by the above principle.</p>
<p>Progress is monitored by the joint distance function, a measure of distance from all cluster centers, that evolves during the iterations, and captures the data in its low contours.</p>
<p>This method is simple, fast (requiring a small number of cheap iterations) and insensitive to outliers.</p></p>

    <p itemprop="description"><p>Anomalies, or say outliers, are the set of data points that are considerably different than the remainder of the data.   Common applications of anomaly detection are credit card fraud detection, telecommunication fraud detection, network intrusion detection, fault detection, and so on.</p>
<p>The working assumption of anomaly detection is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are considerably more “normal” observations than “abnormal” observations (outliers/anomalies) in the data.</p>

Imbalanced class distribution is a scenario where the number of observations belonging to one class is significantly lower than those belonging to the other classes.   This happens because Machine Learning Algorithms are usually designed to improve accuracy by reducing the error. Thus, they do not take into account the class distribution / proportion or balance of classes.</p>

    <p itemprop="description"><p>Association analysis is useful for discovering interesting relationships hidden in large data sets.   The uncovered relationships can be represented in the form of <strong>association rules</strong> or sets of frequent items.</p>
<p>For example, given a table of market basket transactions</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>TID</th>
<th>Items</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>{Bread, Milk}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>{Bread, Diapers, Beer, Eggs}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>{Milk, Diapers, Beer, Cola}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>{Bread, Milk, Diapers, Beer}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>{Bread, Milk, Diapers, Cola}</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The follwing rule can be extracted from the table:</p>
<p>$$
{Milk, Diaper} \rightarrow {Beer}
$$</p>
<p>A common strategy adopted by many association rule mining algorithms is to decompose the problem into 2 major subtasks:</p>
<p><strong>1. Frequent Itemset Generation</strong></p>
<p>Find all the itemsets that satisfy the <em>minsup</em> threshold.</p>
<p><strong>2. Rule Generation</strong></p></p>
